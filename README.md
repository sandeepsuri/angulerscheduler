# angulerscheduler
This is just a simple scheduler I build using Angular 8 Ionic.

The reason I used Ionic is because of it's clean look, simplicity, and the fact that the calendar is pre built from it's library.

I have also connected my calendar to Firebase to store all events

I still have to fix some minor bugs (able to remove an event, and to display the event on the page even when it refreshes).

To run the code, simply download it, go to your terminal and open the file there. Once you're in the file run this following command:

```
ionic serve
```
